# ELEC3662 Calculator Project (2023)

**Author:** George Limpus
**Course:** ELEC3662 – University of Leeds
**Year:** 2023
**Platform:** Tiva C Series LaunchPad

## Overview

This project is a simple calculator implemented in C for the **Tiva C Series LaunchPad** as part of the ELEC3662 course at the University of Leeds in 2023. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using the onboard hardware.

The aim of the project was to gain hands-on experience with embedded systems programming, interfacing with microcontroller peripherals, and implementing user input/output logic on the Tiva LaunchPad.

## Features

* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
* User input through the onboard switches
* Display output via the onboard LEDs or serial terminal (depending on implementation)
* Simple and efficient C code suitable for embedded systems

## Hardware

* **Tiva C Series LaunchPad (TM4C123GH6PM)**

## Software

* **IDE:** Keil
* **Language:** C


## Notes


* Developed and tested in 2023.
* Designed for educational purposes as part of ELEC3662 coursework.
